#To intialize course
my_course=COURSE("CSE","CS F11","Rajiv Kumar",["23-12-2023"])

# To intialize Sections
my_section=SECTIONS("Lecture",["Monday","Wednesday","Friday"],["12pm-01pm","12pm-01pm","12pm-01pm"])
```

### To add section to course

for i in get_section:
    ptint(i)
```

### To enroll a subject into a course and to export it to a csv file

my_timetable=TIMETABLE()
my_timetable.enroll_subject(my_course)
my_timetable.export_to_csv("timetable.csv")

```
### Populating Subjects from Excel

Use the populate_subject function to populate new courses from an Excel spreadsheet. This function reads the spreadsheet, creates new courses, and adds them to the persistent database.

```python
from timemanage import populate_subject

# Provide the path to the Excel file
file_path = "courses.xlsx"

# Populate subjects from the Excel file
populate_subject(file_path)
```
